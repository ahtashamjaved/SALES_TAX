Prerequisite: 
	.Net5, Node package manager and angular 8, devextreme datagrid

Assumptions: 
	Products are linked with categories. 
	Categories would have Tax percentage value. 
	User would select a product and quantity and flag if the product is imported. 
	API call would be initiated to calculate the sales tax and import tax.  
	For front-end application I have used Angular 8 and .NET 5 for the backend. 
	I haven't linked this with database as it was not mentioned in the task. 
	So the total amount would be calculated dynamically.
	
	Though the input seemed as the file, but I have assumed it would be user entry
